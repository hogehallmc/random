# new website planning notes

This is the planning and sketch document for the new hogehallmc website.

## inital plan

The new website will be static, thus no php will be nessary. This has the
disadvantage of being less interactive, but will give us considerably faster
responce times, more control over the apperence, and hopefully a better user
experience. To build and manage the site we will be using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which can be given the source files for the site
and it will build a complete site using those files, making global edits and
theme changes easy.

## example pages and ideas

- leaning toward a minimal design, the home screen would have our logo in the
  center with a backdrop of the map behind it. Maybe something like this:
  ![example site 1](https://proxy.spigotmc.org/ba838b276c98f117c6ea54db957bcdd217687bc5?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimage.prntscr.com%2Fimage%2FNFbdMgGMRZqu8sS07YlrkQ.png)
- I think the home screen should only have our logo, both server's ipaddr, and a link to our discord server. We would then use the other pages to convey info in more depth if needed.
